## Automatic Structure Phase Map (autophasemap) generation
This repository hosts the supporting code for the following paper.
[Metric geometry tools for automatic structure phase map generation](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2023/dd/d3dd00105a) by Kiran Vaddi, Karen Li, and Lilo D Pozzo.

To install the package:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/kiranvad/warping.git 
pip install git+https://github.com/pozzo-research-group/autophasemap.git 
```

A simple example using synthetic Gaussian functions as an example can be found in [this ](/example.ipynb)notebook. This example can be run on your local machine once the `autophasemap` package is installed using similar instructions as above.
